      <p>
        This design was for a project about UI design. The goal was connecting a physical element with a digital
        interface. I designed a mobile app acting as a social layer for gaming: news, profiles, friends, messaging and
        curated collections. The physical counterpart was an NFC business card linking directly to a user profile.

        <li>Create a cohesive mobile interface in Figma.</li>
        <li>Bridge a physical NFC card with a digital profile experience.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the concept at an exposition.</li>
