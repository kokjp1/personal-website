      <p>
        The Boekenzoeker (book finder) project was a school assignment focused on UI design. The goal was to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface for a book discovery and wishlist application. It was designed to be used on an ipad terminal in the OBA (Public Library Amsterdam), aimed at encouraging high school students to read more by reducing the friction of finding and choosing books.
